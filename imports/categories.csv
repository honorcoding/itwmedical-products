25,Fluid / Flow Control,fluid-flow-control,"For more than 10 years, Filtertek has been involved in the development and manufacture of Check Valves that are used in Medical Applications.Following some serious incidents of incorrect amounts of prescribed solutions being infused into critically ill patients, it became very apparent that there was a void in the Check Valve market for a suitable product to prevent such occurrences. The market requirement was for a reliable low opening /cracking pressure check valve with zero backflow on a dual I.V. infusion set under gravity and pump feed. As the application was very demanding, no check valve manufacturer in the industry had produced a satisfactory valve.Filtertek, having recognized the market requirement for a cost effective solution, invented a suitable check valve that would exceed the requirements that had been set out by the market. Such was the innovation in Filtertek’s invention that the Company was shortlisted for a National Innovation Award for new products.Due to its low opening pressure and zero backflow characteristics, the Filtertek check valve acts as a safety valve when a patent is undergoing dual infusion. The Filtertek valve also protects the patent from overdose if occlusion occurs during solution administration and allows further infusion of solutions to take place when required. The valve also prevents backflow into the gravity set if occlusion occurs with the benefit of knowing that the correct volume of fluid has been infused. This assurance greatly aids the Medical Staff in the treatment of the patient.It is now compulsory to use a check valve on a dual infusion sets and the Filtertek valve remains the favoured choice of many OEM’s where it is used in tens of millions of hospital sets.The Filtertek Valve design is protected under patent in the USA and Europe.<b>Browser our Standard Products:</b><a href=""type.asp?group=20311"">Check Valves</a><a href=""type.asp?group=20360"">Vents</a><a href=""type.asp?group=20910"">Transducer Protectors</a>",22,Applications,applications,

28,Needlestick Prevention,needlestick-prevention,"The dangers of accidental needle sticks and other sharps injuries have been well documented. Any needle or other sharp that has been used on a patient poses the risk of transmitting bloodborne pathogens to anyone who is subsequently injured by that needle or sharp. Such injuries, especially deep punctures caused by hollow-bore needles contaminated with blood, are known to have resulted in the transmission of pathogens. For example Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus, and HIV to name a few.In the United States, the use of protective devices is now required by law. In August 2001, the U.S. Joint Commission on Accrediation of Healthcare Organizations issued a Sentinel Event Alert on preventing needlesticks and other sharps injuries. In this Alert, they announced that it will be assessing organizational compliance with the provisions of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act as part of the accreditation process.For over 15 years, Filtertek has developed products to prevent sharps injuries.  We were the first to develop a luer activated valve with a top wiper seal to prevent ingress of bacteria and the first to offer a universal, two-piece needlefree connector to meet the requirements of new applications and open new options for our customers. Along with the patented product designs, Filtertek has also patented the related manufacturing technologies to offer our customers higher quality devices - and protection in the marketplace.",22,Applications,applications,
